  "text": "The old library stood at the corner of Maple Avenue, its weathered brick facade telling stories of decades past. Inside, rows of towering bookshelves stretched toward the ceiling, each one filled with volumes that had been touched by countless curious hands. Dust motes danced in the golden afternoon light streaming through tall windows, creating an almost magical atmosphere. A lone reader sat nestled in a worn leather armchair, completely absorbed in a mystery novel while the world outside carried on unnoticed. The soft ticking of a grandfather clock marked the passing hours, a steady rhythm that had become as familiar as a heartbeat to those who frequented this peaceful sanctuary.\n",
