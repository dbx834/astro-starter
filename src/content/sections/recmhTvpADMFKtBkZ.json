  "text": "The coastal town woke slowly under a blanket of morning fog, its fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbor. Seagulls cried overhead, circling lazily before diving toward the water in search of breakfast. Along the weathered boardwalk, shop owners unlocked their doors and set out colorful displays of handmade crafts and fresh seafood. The smell of salt air mingled with the aroma of baking bread from the corner bakery, where locals gathered each morning to exchange news and gossip. Beyond the breakwater, the endless ocean stretched toward the horizon, its waves keeping time with the unhurried pace of life in this sleepy seaside village.\n",
